## 🚀 About Me

Experienced Frontend Developer with 3+ years of hands-on experience building dynamic, scalable web applications using Angular and React. I specialize in creating reusable, modular UI components and improving user experience through optimized architecture and clean code practices.

I’ve contributed to both frontend and backend aspects of multiple projects, with a strong grip on monorepo structures using NX.js and solid backend integration using PHP and SQL. Whether working on UI kits, scalable SPAs, or full-stack solutions — I bring quality, speed, and collaboration to every team I join.
